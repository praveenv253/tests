Using HTCondor
--------------
<muted>(in CMU)</muted>

1. First, you need to design your program to be able to accept arguments that
   allow it to do a part of the whole task (that's how I'm parallelizing most
   stuff, anyway). eg. `hello.sh`
2. Then, you need to write a script that defines how many jobs are there
   overall, and which job does what - i.e. what arguments are to be passed to
   the program for each job. You also need to set some path parameters.
   eg. `condor_prep_hello.sh`
3. Make sure you read and understand all the comments in the prep script as
   well as in `condor_submit.sh`. The permissions issues discussed there are
   important.
4. Finally, while in the source repository that contains the
   `run_condor_prog.sh` script, source the prep script and the
   `condor_submit.sh` script. This should take care of submitting all your jobs
   to Condor.
