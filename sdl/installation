Getting openGL/SDL to work:

For openGL use:
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

For SDL use:
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

The two do not seem to be interdependant

Compilation is done as follows:

For openGL:
Compile using ++ with -lGL -lGLU and -lglut

For SDL:
Compile using g++ with -lSDL
